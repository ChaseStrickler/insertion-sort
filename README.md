# insertion-sort
This program performs insertion sort on arrays of size 10, 100, 1000, and 10,000. It keeps track of how many swaps/comparisons happen on average on ten different inputs of equal size. 
A write-up will be added to this repository in the near future that analyzes the run-time of insertion sort.
