# insertion-sort
This program performs insertion sort on arrays of size 10, 100, 1000, and 10,000. It keeps track of how many swaps/comparisons happen on average on ten different inputs of equal size. 

I've included my analysis of the algorithm, although I must mention that the graph included in the paper is deceiving, and the x-values don't increase linearlly as is suggested visually.
